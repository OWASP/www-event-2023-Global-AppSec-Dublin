    abstract: Join us for a delicious journey into the world of privacy engineering! As data protection legislation becomes increasingly prevalent, it's more important than ever to understand how to keep your software systems safe from privacy threats. In this talk, we'll explore what privacy is all about, why it matters, and how threat modeling can help you introduce it early on in the software development lifecycle. We'll tackle some common misconceptions about privacy and threat modeling along the way. And we'll talk about ice cream. Yum!

        The use of AI in software development is on the rise, and for a good reason. AI-assisted coding has the potential to revolutionize the way we write code, making the process faster, more efficient, and more accurate, and especially more secure. In this keynote, we will discuss the current state of AI-assisted coding and its potential future impact on the software development industry and cybersecurity. We will explore the different ways AI can support code writing, such as code completion, error detection, and automated testing. However, the use of AI in software development also comes with a set of challenges, including intellectual property ownership, legal issues, and privacy concerns. This keynote will provide a comprehensive understanding of how AI can be used in software development, its potential impact on the industry, as well as the challenges and opportunities that come with it. It will also equip attendees with the knowledge and tools to understand the legal and ethical issues surrounding AI-assisted coding.
