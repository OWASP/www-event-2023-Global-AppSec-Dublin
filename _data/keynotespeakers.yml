    abstract: Join us for a delicious journey into the world of privacy engineering! As data protection legislation becomes increasingly prevalent, it's more important than ever to understand how to keep your software systems safe from privacy threats. In this talk, we'll explore what privacy is all about, why it matters, and how threat modeling can help you introduce it early on in the software development lifecycle. We'll tackle some common misconceptions about privacy and threat modeling along the way. And we'll talk about ice cream. Yum!
